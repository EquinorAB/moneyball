## transaction/unsigned [POST /transaction/unsigned]

Creates an unsigned transaction with the supplied data (which can be used to make a signed transaction) - The transaction is returned in the response with a generated Id which can then be signed and used with the create (signed) transaction API call.
See this page for help with signing [Signing & Sending Transactions](https://guide.axentro.io/using-the-api/signing-and-sending-transactions)

### Post Body

The post body is made up of the following mandatory fields:

* action
* senders
* recipients
* message
* token
* kind
* version

#### Action

action is the type of action to perform - e.g send - is when you want to send some tokens to an address. Send is the most common but there are others like create_token etc as well as those used in human readable addresses. Also users can create their own actions as part of building dApps.

```json
{"action":"send" ...}
```

#### Senders

This is information about where a payment or action originates - e.g. the address from which to send tokens from. It's made up of an address, amount, fee and public key. It's a list of senders but generally there is only one
The amount in the senders should be the same amount as put into the recipients for sending tokens

```json
{
  "senders": 
  [  
    {
      "address": "the-address", 
      "amount": "1000", 
      "fee":"1",
      "public_key":"the-public-key",
      "signature":"0",
    }
  ] 
  ...
}
```

#### Recipients

This is information about when a payment of action is going - e.g. the destination address when sending tokens. It's made up of an address and amount. It's a list of recipients but generally there is only one
The amount in the recipients should be the same as the amount put into the senders for sending tokens

```json
{
  "recipients": 
    [
      {
        "address": "the-address",
        "amount":"1000"
      }
    ] 
    ...
}
```

#### Message

This is a place to but arbitrary data related to the transaction - for sending tokens it's generally empty - but it's useful when building dapps.

```json
{"message": "some message" ...}
```

#### Token

This is the token to use - generally it's AXNT but it can be any other user created token

```json
{"token": "AXNT" ...}
```

#### Kind

This is the transaction speed either FAST or SLOW 

```json
{"kind": "FAST" ...}
```

#### Version

This is the version of the transaction - currently we only have V1

```json
{"version": "V1" ...}
```

#### A complete request body

## transaction/signed [POST /transaction]

Creates a signed transaction with the supplied data (use after creating an unsigned transaction). The first step is to create an unsigned transaction using the 
unsigned transaction API. The response from the unsigned call is then used as the payload for this signed API call to send a transaction. The response from the unsigned call
will return a transactionId as well as the timestamp and the scaled value.

See this page for help with signing [Signing & Sending Transactions](https://guide.axentro.io/using-the-api/signing-and-sending-transactions)

### Post Body

The post body is made up of the following mandatory fields:

* action

* message
* token
* kind
* version

#### Kind

This is the transaction speed either FAST or SLOW 

```json
{"kind": "FAST" ...}
```

#### Version

This is the version of the transaction - currently we only have V1

```json
{"version": "V1" ...}
```

#### Prev Hash

The response from the unsigned call will contain the prev hash field which is the hash of the previous transaction. It is required to prove the authenticity of the transaction. 
When the transaction is successful then the prev_hash value will be populated while adding it to the block.

```json
{"prev_hash": "0" ...}
```

#### Timestamp

The timestamp of the transaction (should be returned by the create unsigned transaction api call)

```json
{"timestamp":1529781499 ...}
```

#### Scaled

The amount field is either an Int or a Decimal - this flag sets the type of value to expect (0 = Decimal, 1 = Int) - This is because amounts are stored in the blockchain as Int but used as a decimal with 8 places e.g. 0.00000001 (should be returned by the create unsigned transaction api call)

```json
{"scaled":1 ...}
```

### Signing a Sender

To create a transaction that will be accepted by the node you have to sign it with your private key (signing happens inside Senders). A typical usage pattern is to first create an unsigned transaction using the API which will return the original transaction but with an Id and prev hash and then use this to create a signed transaction and send it via this API call. See the help with signing page on the wiki.

```json
{"signature": "some-signature", ...}
```

## transaction/send_token/unsigned [POST /transaction/send_token/unsigned]

Generates a transaction from the supplied data to be used in the transaction api call.

The post body is made up of the following mandatory fields:

* from_address
* public_key (for the from_address)
* amount to send (a string e.g. '50' or '0.1')
* fee (should be string '0.0001' for sending tokens)
* to_address
* kind - the transaction kind - should be FAST 

Use the json payload that is returned to POST in the transaction endpoint to create a transaction (after signing the transaction)
